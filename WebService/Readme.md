# 🌐 WebService Infrastructure on Azure

This project automates the deployment of a scalable web infrastructure on **Azure** using **Terraform**, **Ansible**, and **GitHub Actions**, with **Cloudflare** integration for DNS and Let's Encrypt SSL certificates.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Terraform** – Infrastructure provisioning on Azure
- **Ansible** – Server configuration and NGINX setup
- **Cloudflare** – DNS and SSL certificate management
- **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD automation pipeline

## 🚀 What Does It Do?

1. Creates 2 Linux virtual machines (VMs) on Azure
2. Configures a Load Balancer with NAT rules for SSH access
3. Installs NGINX and deploys a PHP web application from GitHub
4. Automatically configures a DNS A record on Cloudflare
5. Installs SSL certificates from Let’s Encrypt on both VMs
6. Ensures high availability by alternating VM activation during SSL setup

## 🔐 Required Secrets

To enable the pipeline to deploy to your Azure subscription and connect via Ansible, set the following **GitHub Secrets** in your repository (`Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`):

- `ARM_CLIENT_ID`
- `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
- `ARM_TENANT_ID`
- `VM_ADMIN_USER`
- `VM_ADMIN_PASSWORD`

If you deployed the AD before, you should have the above secrets configured yet. Now you will have to configure these new secrets:
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` 
- `CLOUDFLARE_RECORD_NAME`
- `CLOUDFLARE_DOMAIN`
- `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID`
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`

> ⚠️**Note** you must generate a key pair on your machine, then upload the public key to WebService/terraform directory and must be called **id_rsa.pub**, then the private key must be in the **SSH_PRIVATE_KEY** secret.

## ⚙️ Deployment


### To deploy from GitHub:

#### Set up the code for the web page
1. Fork [This Repo](https://github.com/LUI5DA/webService-php)
2. Go to webService-php/php/login.php
3. Update the ip in line 10, with your Windows Server VM IP wich serves the Active Directory Service


#### set up the code repo in this project
1. go to ansible/playbooks/setup_nginx.yml
2. update the line 72, paste the url of the repo that you forked before with the webpage code.
3. Go to the **Actions** tab.
4. Select `Deploy WebService Infrastructure...`
5. Click **Run workflow**
6. The infrastructure and configuration will be handled automatically.

## 🌐 Access

Once the workflow completes, your website will be available at: / https://<CLOUDFLARE_RECORD_NAME>.<CLOUDFLARE_DOMAIN>

## ⚡ Notes

- Destroy infrastructure after use to avoid unnecessary costs:
  ```bash
  cd terraform
  terraform destroy
  ```
- Customize `variables.tf` and `terraform.tfvars` for your environment.
- The pipeline can be extended to include tests, notifications, or more advanced deployment logic.
